            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Experience a NASA Spacewalk Through the Lens of a GoPro Camera</h1><p>Want to see what it's like to "walk" around in space outside the International Space Station? NASA wants to show you. The agency recently strapped GoPro cameras onto two astronauts to capture the wonder of spacewalks from their perspective.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/d3d0f4303f6b7750f52857db8c393871f382887d.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Light painting with pixelstick</h1><p>More info at thepixelstick.com! We spent the last year building pixelstick, a light painting tool capable of everything from photo-real renders to amazing abstract ribbons. We've improved with every iteration and are excited to finally show off what it can do. Everything was shot by just two slightly sleep deprived guys and one Pixelstick in Brooklyn.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/5080ae11f6ad71390eca523c2eba50c17928b5da.jpg"></article>]]></description>
